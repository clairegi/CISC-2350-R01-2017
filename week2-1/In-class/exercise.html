		<h1>What is TED?</h1>

		<!-- paragraphs -->
		<p>TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less).<br> TED began in 1984 as a conference where <b>Technology, Entertainment and Design</b> converged, and today covers<br> almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, <br>independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.</p>
		
		<p>TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. Our agenda is to make great ideas accessible<br> and spark conversation.</p>
