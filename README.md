This is a group that we will use for class communication. <br>
The purpose of this group is for course-related announcements, discussion and questions. This is a great place to ask questions about what you're working on or things you're struggling with technically. You may of course email me individually, but most likely someone else in the class has the same question so it's a great way to learn from each other.

## Course description

This 15-week course introduces students to the basics of web design and programming for the web. Students will work primarily with HTML and CSS to build the structural and visual components of a website, using CSS to integrate interaction and animation. In the second half of the semester, students will be introduced to other libraries for responsive design (Bootstrap) and languages (JavaScript) to create more complex, interactive websites.

By the end of the course, students should be able to build a fully functional website to share what they are mostly passionate about. To be more specific students should be able to:
* Write HTML to create the structural foundation of a website, and use it at an intermediate level
* Style websites with CSS, and make websites dynamic with CSS transitions
* Know basics how to use JavaScript to control the behavior of a website
* Create a unique website based on their own designs and visual ideas, considering key aspects of visual systems, interaction and user experience
* Debug their work and know how to search for necessary documentation or supplemental information
* Use Github and Github Pages to post homework
* Know the basic technical vocabulary of the front-end web, so that they can pursue more advanced web programming; this includes understanding the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript and being able to read the HTML / CSS of other websites using browser’s developer tools
* Incorporate libraries such as Bootstrap to create responsive designs
* Be aware of upper level tools that are available in real web development world (different libraries, web hosting, etc.)

## Work and requirements

### Course deliverables

**1. Weekly homework** <br>
Each week you’ll have a homework assignment that requires mastery of the material we covered in class the week before. These will be primarily design and technical exercises, with an occasional reading or watch video assignment. <br>
Homework assignments must be posted on GitHub **by 6pm on Wednesday** evenings for me to be able to look them over before class. **I will not accept late homework**.

**2. Presentation: website review (2 students per week)** <br>
Every student will have to give an individual 5-7 minute presentation on a website that you feel is interesting and innovative. You will talk about the concept, structure, design, usability and technology behind it.

There will be 2 students presenting per week.

Please read the presentation guidelines and sign up for a slot [here](https://github.com/rutaitp/CISC-2350-R01-2017/wiki/Presentation-Assignment-&-Signup).

**3. Midterm (Due Week 7)** <br>
The midterm project will be a website responding to one of the assignment prompts (for example, your interactive self portrait, redesign of an existing site, a piece of hypertext narrative).

There will be a set of additional technical requirements students must meet for this assignment - they together with assignment prompts will be reviewed later in the semester.

**4. Final project (Due Week 15)** <br>
The final project will be a full-scale website design and implementation that can either be a development of a midterm or a completely new website (e.g. portfolio site for yourself). Unlike the midterm, which is a shorter assignment, students will be required to go through a full design process of sketching, wireframing, designing and then building out this site. Exact requirements students must meet for this assignment will be reviewed later in the semester.

### Attendance <br>
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of each class.

This class meets for 1 hour and 15 minutes twice per week. Students are expected to come on time, because there is a lot of material to cover. Students who come in later than 20 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.

If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand and explain why.
* 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence.
* 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-).
* More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.

The full academic calendar is [here](https://go.activecalendar.com/FordhamUniversity/site/academic/?view=grid&search=y) for your reference.

### Participation in class <br>
Participation is mandatory in this class. Students are expected to engage actively in class discussions, presentations and technical demos. Students must come each week prepared to pay attention and participate actively in class.

Asking questions is highly encouraged. There are no stupid questions; if you have a question, most likely somebody else in the room has the same one.

### Grading criteria <br>
Students will be assessed on both technical skills as well as critical thinking, creativity and presentation. Grades are based on completion and quality of projects, homework assignments, class participation and attendance. Assignment due dates are hard dates, which means points will be deducted for late assignments and homework.

Final grades in the course will reflect the following:
* Participation and Attendance - 20%
* Weekly homework assignments - 20%
* Website presentation - 10%
* Midterm Project - 20%
* Final Project - 30%

And in general, grades are determined according to the following breakdown:
* A = 90-100%, excellent work
* B = 80-89%, above average work
* C = 70-79%, average or competent work
* D = 60-69%, below average work
* F = 0-59%, unsatisfactory work

**Please note:** Assignments must be posted on GitHub **by 6pm on Wednesday** evenings for me to be able to review them before class. **5% will be deducted per late assignment per day.**

### Computer use in the classroom <br>
When we’re looking at code together or doing an in-class exercise, students will need to be working using a computer. However, when your classmates are presenting and during group discussions, you are expected to refrain from using the computer. Additionally:
* No eating or drinking is allowed in the classrooms or computer labs.
* No email, social media or cell phone use in class.
* Since we’re meeting for 1h 15min only, there most likely won’t be any break. Try to let me know beforehand if you may need to leave a class.
* It’s possible for you to use Computer Lab (330, 331 rooms) for extra work if these labs are not being used for instructional purposes. No signup needed.

### Academic Integrity <br>
Academic integrity is a serious thing. Please read over [Fordham University’s Academic Honor Code here](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21559/graduate_academic_advising/3450/academic_honor_code). <br>
Fordham University’s policy against plagiarism and copying is very strict; however, in the world of programming, sharing and repurposing code is often encouraged. It’s ok to look at other people’s code or refer to examples, but be sure to always give credit and acknowledge your sources.

### Disability <br>
Feel free to speak to me in person about special accommodations you may need.

### Discrimination and Harassment <br>
Discrimination and harassment are behaviors that are incompatible with the standard of conduct required of a member of the Fordham University community in the workplace or in any college-related setting, including but not limited to off-campus, college-related events and activities. More information on [the Fordham University website here](https://www.fordham.edu/info/22823/discrimination).
