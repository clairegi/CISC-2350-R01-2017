		<p>Already one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, Irma could become one <br>of the most destructive as well, depending on its path, and officials from Turks and Caicos to Florida pleaded with <br>people to heed advisories to evacuate to shelters and higher ground. The National Hurricane Center described the <br>hurricane as “potentially catastrophic.” <br><br>

The storm made direct hits on Barbuda, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin, Anguilla and the <br>British Virgin Islands, and raked the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with hurricane-force wind and torrential <br>rain. Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said Irma had destroyed 95 percent of the structures on Barbuda, an <br>island with about 1,600 people. <br><br>

The authorities confirmed that the hurricane had killed at least one person in <br>Antigua and Barbuda; one on Anguilla, a British possession; and two in French territory, which includes St. Barthélemy <br>and the northern part of St. Martin. Another died in Puerto Rico while preparing for the storm.</p>
